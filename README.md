# Hi, I'm Beck! 👋

### ☁️ Cloud Native Engineer & Go Developer

**Infrastructure Reliability** • **Backend Systems** • **Continuous Improvement**

<br>

I am a software engineer based in Taiwan, focusing on **Kubernetes operations** and **Cloud Native architecture**.

I enjoy bridging the gap between infrastructure and application logic to build stable, scalable environments.

### 💻 What I'm Working On

- **☸️ Kubernetes Operations**:
  Helping maintain **13+ clusters (GKE & EKS)**. My daily focus is on automation, reliability, and streamlining workflows using `Helm`, `Kustomize`, and `k9s`.

- **📡 Backend & Observability**:
  Developed a **Golang-based monitoring service** to assist the DBA team. It currently tracks **500+ MySQL instances** concurrently, aiming to provide real-time visibility with minimal overhead.

- **🌱 Learning & Exploring**:
  Always looking to improve current architectures. I'm currently experimenting with **AI Agent patterns (Google ADK)** and studying the transition to **Kubernetes Gateway API**.
